/**
 * Lifecycle state of a media player.
 *
 * - `idle` — created but not yet started loading
 * - `loading` — buffering / fetching headers
 * - `ready` — first chunk decoded, ready to play
 * - `playing` — actively rendering audio
 * - `paused` — playback paused (position preserved)
 * - `ended` — reached end of stream
 * - `error` — irrecoverable failure (network, codec, etc.)
 *
 * `ended` is fired both from the platform's end-of-playback signal
 * (`AVPlayerItemDidPlayToEndTimeNotification`, `MediaPlayer.OnCompletion`,
 * GStreamer `EOS`, MF `MEEnded`) **and** from a `currentTime ≈ duration`
 * fallback — see issue #351 for the rationale (Chromium / Chromecast have
 * historically dropped the native event in places, and the same belt-and-
 * braces is cheap to apply here).

 * Create a media player for the given URL. Returns a 1-based handle, or
 * `0` on failure. Supports HTTP/HTTPS streaming URLs (Subsonic, Icecast,
 * Shoutcast, plain progressive MP3/AAC, HLS m3u8) and `file://` paths.
 *
 * The player loads asynchronously. Register `onStateChange` first if you
 * want to call `play()` exactly when the player transitions to `"ready"`;
 * otherwise calling `play()` immediately also works — the platform backend
 * starts playback automatically once buffering completes.
